## ⚡ Real-Life Analogy

Think of **GenAI** like a **very smart intern**.  
It learns from the company data (training set), performs tasks (inference), but —  
if not properly trained or monitored — it might **leak confidential information** or **be tricked** into revealing secrets.

That’s why **GenAI Security** exists: to ensure your AI acts safely and responsibly.
