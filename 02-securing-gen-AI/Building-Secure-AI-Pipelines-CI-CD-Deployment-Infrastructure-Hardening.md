##🧩 Lesson 9: Securing AI Pipelines and Model Supply Chains

### 🚀 Objective

Understand the end-to-end security of AI pipelines — from data ingestion to deployment — and how to detect and prevent supply chain attacks in GenAI environments.

## 🔍 1. What is an AI Pipeline?

An **AI pipeline** is the workflow that transforms data into a deployed model. It typically includes:

1. **Data Collection** → sourcing and preprocessing data
2. **Model Training** → building and tuning the model
3. **Evaluation** → validating performance
4. **Deployment** → integrating the model into production systems
5. **Monitoring** → ensuring stability and detecting anomalies

## 🧠 2. Attack Surfaces in AI Pipelines

| Stage           | Common Threats      | Example                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Data Collection | Data poisoning      | Malicious data injected during scraping |
| Model Training  | Backdoor injection  | Hidden triggers in weights              |
| Model Storage   | Unauthorized access | Leaking `.pt` or `.pkl` models          |
| Deployment      | API exploitation    | Exposed inference endpoints             |
| Monitoring      | Evasion attacks     | Model fails to detect adversarial drift |

---

## 🛡️ 3. Model Supply Chain Risks

The **model supply chain** includes every dependency — datasets, pretrained models, libraries, and APIs.
Attackers often target these components to compromise the entire system.

**Real-world example:**
In 2023, a malicious PyPI package disguised as a deep learning library was found stealing API keys.

**Lesson:** Always verify and sign dependencies before use.

## 🧰 4. Best Practices for AI Pipeline Security

| Area                | Practice                | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Code Security    | Use signed dependencies | Validate Python packages (e.g., with `pip-audit`) |
| 🧬 Data Integrity   | Hash data at ingestion  | Verify datasets using SHA-256                     |
| 🧩 Model Validation | Use reproducible builds | Store model training metadata                     |
| 🧠 Monitoring       | Track data/model drift  | Use MLflow or Evidently AI                        |
| 🚨 Access Control   | Isolate environments    | Use IAM and network segmentation                  |

## 🧾 5. Example: Pipeline Security Implementation (Python)

```python
import hashlib
import os

def verify_data_integrity(file_path, known_hash):
    """Check if dataset file matches expected SHA-256 hash."""
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256()
    with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
        for byte_block in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            sha256_hash.update(byte_block)
    file_hash = sha256_hash.hexdigest()
    
    if file_hash == known_hash:
        print("✅ Data integrity verified.")
    else:
        print("⚠️ Data integrity check failed!")
        raise ValueError("Dataset may have been tampered with.")

# Example usage
verify_data_integrity("train.csv", "2b2d2e9c5f3d4e9...your_known_hash_here")
```

**Explanation:**
This simple script validates dataset integrity before training, ensuring that no poisoned data sneaks into your pipeline.

## 🧩 6. Real-World Example

**Case Study:**
An AI model deployed by a financial institution was compromised when an attacker uploaded a malicious retrained model with embedded exfiltration code.
After the breach, the company introduced model signing and automated dependency scanning.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* Treat the AI pipeline like a software supply chain.
* Verify data, dependencies, and models.
* Continuously monitor drift and security anomalies.
* Implement digital signatures for all artifacts.

## 🧠 Pro Tip

> Use **Reproducible AI Pipelines** — tools like **DVC (Data Version Control)** and **MLflow** can automatically track and hash all stages, preventing silent modifications.
